# üåê Decentralized Freelancing Platform (Ethereum & Polygon)

This decentralized freelancing platform is deployed on **Ethereum** and **Polygon** blockchains, providing secure and efficient transactions between clients and freelancers.

---

## üè† Home Page

Upon opening the platform, the home page appears with two main options:

- **üë®‚Äçüíª Become a Freelancer**: If you want to work as a freelancer, click on the **Freelancer** button.
- **üë®‚Äçüíº Become a Client**: If you are looking to hire freelancers, click on the **Client** button.

Once you click on either option, you will need to connect your **MetaMask** wallet to sign up. The platform will automatically fetch your wallet address for use in transactions and identification.

---

## üíº Client Registration

To become a **Client**, after connecting your MetaMask wallet:

1. You will be asked to enter your **name**.
2. Provide a **description** of your company or the types of work you are looking to have done.
3. Your wallet **address** will be automatically fetched.

The description should clearly explain the kind of work you want to get done, allowing freelancers to easily understand the job. You can add unique elements like **emoji** or **images** to make the job post more visually clear.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Freelancer Registration

To become a **Freelancer**, after connecting your MetaMask wallet:

1. You will be prompted to enter your **name**.
2. Provide a **description** of your skills** and expertise.
3. Optionally, share a link to your **certificates** or portfolios, which can be stored on a decentralized storage network.
4. Your wallet **address** will be automatically fetched.

This section allows freelancers to showcase what services they can offer and gives them the option to share credentials or certificates for verification.

---

## üìù Posting a Job (Client)

Once registered as a client, you can post jobs by following these steps:

1. **Job Category**: Select a job category, such as Blockchain Development, Video Editing, etc.
2. **Job Description**: Provide a detailed description of the work to be done. Include important details using unique symbols, **emojis**, or **images** for clarity.
3. **Payment**: Set the amount of **ETH** for the job and specify the payment type (Hourly, Part-Time, or Full-Time).
4. Once the job is posted, it will show up in the job listings with all the details you've provided.

---

## üîç Searching for Jobs (Freelancer)

Freelancers can search for jobs using keywords based on their skills. Once a job is selected, they can view:

- **Category**: The job‚Äôs category (e.g., Blockchain Development).
- **Description**: The client‚Äôs job details.
- **Payment Details**: The amount offered and payment type.
- **Client Address**: Freelancers can copy the client‚Äôs address to initiate private communication via the chat feature.

Freelancers can chat privately with the client to discuss job details and finalize the terms.

---

## üõí Placing an Order (Client)

Once a freelancer agrees to a job, the client can place an order:

1. **Freelancer's Address**: Copy the freelancer‚Äôs address from the chat and paste it into the **Place Order** form.
2. **JobID**: After the contract is agreed upon, the platform will provide a unique **JobID**.
3. **Payment & Review**: Clients can enter the agreed payment, and the platform will automatically deduct a 1% tax before holding the funds in the contract. Once the work is completed, the funds will be released to the freelancer.

---

## ‚è± Job Completion & Payment

After the freelancer completes the job, they will submit their work by providing:

- **Job Link**: The URL to the completed work.
- **JobID**: The JobID from the order.

Once submitted, the **timer** starts. If the client does not respond within the agreed timeframe, the freelancer can run the `Complete` function to automatically withdraw funds (with a 1% tax).

If the client requests changes, they must do so within the given time. If the client is unsatisfied with the work, they can request a job revision. However, if they are satisfied, they can release the funds to the freelancer.

In case of cancellation, the client can cancel the order and the funds will be returned to their wallet.

---

## üìä Reviews & Ratings

Clients and freelancers can rate each other using the **JobID**. Both parties can leave reviews, and **symbols**, **emojis**, and **images** can be used to indicate where sentences end to ensure clarity in feedback.

---

## üì¶ Security Features

To ensure the platform is secure and reliable, the following features have been implemented:

1. **Reentrancy Attack Prevention**: To prevent reentrancy attacks, we use **OpenZeppelin**'s security library.
2. **Safe Transfers**: The platform uses **OpenZeppelin**'s safe transfer libraries to ensure funds are transferred securely.
3. **Emergency Stop**: The contract owner has the ability to **pause** and **unpause** the contract in case of emergencies, using OpenZeppelin's **Pausable** feature.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Recommended version: `v14.x.x` or later
   - Run this command to verify Node.js installation:  
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

2. **npm or Yarn**: Ensure you have either npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn installed. npm is included with Node.js, but if you want to install Yarn, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

3. **MetaMask**: Install the **MetaMask** browser extension to interact with the Ethereum or Polygon networks. Download it from [here](https://metamask.io/download.html).

4. **Truffle or Hardhat**: You'll need a framework for Ethereum development:
   - **Truffle**: Install Truffle using:
     ```bash
     npm install -g truffle
     ```
   - **Hardhat**: Install Hardhat using:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev hardhat
     ```

5. **Solidity Compiler**: Ensure that the Solidity compiler is installed for compiling smart contracts.
   - You can use the Solidity plugin in **Truffle** or **Hardhat**.

6. **Ethereum/Polygon Testnet Faucet**: To test the platform, you'll need test ETH or MATIC for gas fees. You can get free test tokens from these faucets:
   - **Ethereum (Goerli) Faucet**: [Link](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/)
   - **Polygon Mumbai Faucet**: [Link](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
